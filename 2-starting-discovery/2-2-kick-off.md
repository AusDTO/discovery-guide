title: '2.2. The kick off'
---

The Discovery starts with a kick-off session, which includes the whole team, plus subject matter experts and business owners. It’s helpful for senior stakeholders to drop in for a short while too. Kicking off a Discovery is typically a collection of high-energy collaborative workshops over the course of 2 days.

Before the session, you should collect existing research and data around the service and the current user experience.

A good kick-off should:

- establish the team with a team-building exercise, allow the team to really understand the skills and interests of each other 
- clearly articulate the role definitions, and agree the roles of each person in the team 
- cover what you already know about the problem space 
- build a vision statement of what you’re trying to do 
- define what success looks like at the end of the Discovery: the things you want to find out, and the artefacts you need to produce (see the section later in this document) 
- discuss the hopes and concerns about the Discovery, and how they can be mitigated 
- set out the timeframe, the key milestones, when (and how often) you’ll be reporting back to stakeholders 
- agree how you’re going to work:
  - the team principles and values, and the ground rules
  - the operating rhythm, team rituals: stand ups, planning, showcases and retrospectives
  - the channels you will use to communicate
  - how you will keep track of the tasks you’re working on? (JIRA, kanban wall)
  - where you’ll be based
  - who will be working on what
