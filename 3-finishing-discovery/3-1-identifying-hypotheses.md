title: '3.1. Identifying the hypotheses to test'
---

During the Discovery phase, youâ€™ll use your research and observations to formulate a hypothesis for the service.

The hypothesis will be tested with prototypes during the Alpha phase.  It is important to note that a hypothesis is not the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  The scope of the MVP is defined at the end of the Alpha phase.  

To move beyond Discovery, the team needs to decide on which hypotheses you want to test at alpha.
