title: '3.3. Assessing against the Digital Service Standard'
---

At the end of Discovery you should be able to demonstrate that you meet the first few criteria of the Digital Service Standard.

## 3.3.1. Criteria 1

Understand user needs. Research to develop a deep knowledge of the users and their context for the service.

The team can meet this criteria by:

- Knowing who the users of the service are
- Understanding the user cohorts and their requirements
- Having detailed demographic/ethnographic information and behaviour patterns of the users
- Knowing the preferred platforms to access the service
- Understanding the key touch points and pain points in the current user journey
- Articulating insights that identify design requirements; both digital and assisted digital
- Explaining their user research approach, plan and findings.

Design guides that will be helpful in meeting this criteria include: [affinity diagramming](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/affinity-diagramming); [card sorting](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/card-sorting); [ethnographic research](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/ethnographic-research); [high level design](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/high-level-design); [interviews](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/interviews); [personas](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/personas); [professional research methods](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/professional-research-methods); [scenarios](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/scenarios); [user pathways](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/user-pathways); [user research](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/guide/user-research); [user stories](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/user-stories); [workshops](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/workshops).

Potential artefacts that are likely to be produced during Discovery:

- a map of the users experience of the service
- a user research plan
- user stories
- user journey maps
- user profiles and personas

## 3.3.2. Criteria 2

Establish a sustainable multi-disciplinary team that can design, build, operate and iterate the service, led by an experienced service manager with decision-making responsibility.

The team can meet this criteria by:

- Establishing the right skills and capabilities within the team
- Defining the roles needed and articulating the role of each person in the team
- Understand the additional skills that will be needed and how to access them (SME’s etc)a
- Defining the decision making process, stakeholders and approval processes
- Establishing the team principles, vision, rituals and practices
- Demonstrating that they are working an Agile way using tools and techniques that support collaboration and communication

Design guides that will be helpful in meeting this criteria include: [team recruitment](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/subguides/team-recruitment); [the team](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/guide/team); [agile](https://www.dto.gov.au/design-guides/guide/agile);

Potential artefacts that are likely to be produced during Discovery:

- team structure
- team skills and roles
- gap analysis
- decision tree
- approval process

## 3.3.3. Tracking progress against the Standard

The first formal assessment occurs after the Alpha stage and covers the first few criteria of the Standard.

Maintaining a Digital Service Standard Kanban board helps the team to keep track of how they are meeting the Standard. Using red, amber or green post-it notes increases visibility of the status of each criteria. Including a snapshot of the board in weekly showcases is a good way to keep your stakeholders informed of progress, and helps the team to identify any blockers.

Capturing evidence as you go along will help you to know when you’re ready for the assessment, and make it easier to prepare.
